To start HIVE:hive

To create database in hive:create database <database name>;

To create table in hive:create table retail_db.categories(category_id int,category_department_id int,category_name varchar(45)) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;

To load data:  
load data inpath '/path of data present in HDFS' overwrite into table retail_db.categories;\





select * from customer where customer_id=(
select customer_id from orders
group by customer_id
having count(*)>=all(select count(customer_id)
                     from orders
                     group by customer_id))


SELECT *
FROM Orders, customer
WHERE orders.cust_id=customer.customer_id
and orders.customer_id IN
            (SELECT TOP (1) o.customer_id
            FROM Orders AS O
            GROUP BY O.customer_id
            ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC);
